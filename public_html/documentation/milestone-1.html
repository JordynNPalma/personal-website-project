      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p>Mandy Martinez</p>
      <h3>Profession</h3>
      <p>Mandy is a UX/UI designer who has been in the industry since 2010. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she left her role at a large marketing firm to start her web development and marketing business, Super Solutions LLC. Mandy has established her business as a reliable web development firm over the last few years. She has room in her budget to hire another developer and graphic designer for her team.</p>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>Mandy is a Mac and Linux user. She uses Mac and Linux systems for everything from Graphic Design to Programming. For her day-to-day work, she uses a brand new M2 Pro Mac Mini with two monitors, which can handle her programming needs and runs the Adobe Creative Suite well. She also has a Lenovo laptop with Linux installed. She has an iPhone 14 Pro.</p>
      <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
      <p>Mandy's schedule is often full. Between running her business, networking to find potential clients, being a single mom, and handling her web development projects, she only has a little free time to look for new team members. She is passionate about elevating entrepreneurs and being involved in her community as a designer. To connect with potential clients and find employees, she spends a lot of her time on LinkedIn, is a member of several development social groups in her community, and will attend job fairs if she has the time.</p>
      <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
      <p>Super Solutions LLC is still a small company with much larger competitors with more connections. Mandy is looking for someone she can hire within her network who can work on a contract basis, as she can only offer benefits once Super Solutions LLC becomes larger. Her company is run remotely, and she is looking for candidates who have previous work-from-home experience and knows how to use communication tools such as Slack, Monday.com, and Zoom. While she is willing to hire an inexperienced developer, she only has the time to do a little training, so she is looking for a candidate with a wide range of talents who can demonstrate technical know-how and willingness to problem-solve.</p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>Mandy wants to connect with a developer she could potentially add to her team at Super Solutions. She wants to quickly evaluate if someone is a good fit for her team based on previous experience, the versatility of their work, and their connections to the communities that she is a part of.</p>
      <h3>User Story</h3>
      <p>As a user, I want to find someone in my community who can work for Super Solutions on a contract basis and be able to contact them via email or LinkedIn.</p>
