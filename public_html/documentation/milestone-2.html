<!--Content Strategy-->
<div>
  <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
  <p>My site will be a single page consisting of:</p>
  <h3>Welcome/Introduction</h3>
  <p>This section will be the introductory portion of the site. It will have a navigation bar that will direct to other site sections. It will be the most design-heavy element of the site, as it will be what viewers see first. The predominant feature of this section is an animated avatar of myself (likely a .gif) welcoming users. This avatar will have a speech bubble that will have a welcome message or welcoming emoji placed into it. There will be a small icon underneath the avatar that will direct users to my LinkedIn profile. The introductory section will have my name, role, and a short description of my skills/capabilities. A scroll indicator on the full screen layout will inform users that they will need to scroll down to see more. The background will be dark.</p>
  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>This section contains two parts and will outline my expertise and experience as a graphic designer and web developer. The first part of this section will be a brief resume outlining any related jobs I have had in this field. This part will be laid out in columns on the page, with a button incorporated into it where folks can download a PDF of my full resume. The second part of this section will outline my skill set with various technology and design platforms. It will be broken into relevant categories using a grid. Within each box/grid item, I will use iconography to outline relevant software and applications that I am familiar with.</p>
  <h3>Project Highlights</h3>
  <p>This site section will be a responsive gallery of some of my most substantial projects. The user should be able to click on each image in the gallery to activate a pop-up window for the project. The pop-up window should contain a brief overview of the project, my role, and what technologies I used, implementing the same iconography from the Experience section of the site. This section will have a dark background to separate it from the experience section before it.</p>
  <h3>Contact</h3>
  <p>This section will contain a list of ways to contact me. It will include, at a minimum, my email, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile. This section should be large on mobile, with my contact information being front and center. This section will have a dark background. </p>
